# Financial Mathematics University Course

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and code from my university course in Financial Mathematics. The projects focus on the computational and stochastic aspects of quantitative finance, implementing key models and numerical methods from scratch.

## Core Concepts Explored

*   **Random Number Generation:** Foundations of simulation using various pseudo-random number generators.
*   **Stochastic Process Generation:** Simulating paths for fundamental processes like Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).
*   **CRR Model (Cox-Ross-Rubinstein):** A binomial options pricing model for discrete-time option valuation.
*   **Variance Reduction Techniques:** Implementing methods like Antithetic Variates and Control Variates to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations.
*   **Option Pricing:** Numerical valuation of European and American options using different models.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Using random sampling to price derivative securities and estimate financial quantities.
*   **Black-Scholes Model:** Analytical solution for European option pricing and analysis of the Greeks.
